A large regular hexagon is cut from a triangular grid and tiled with diamonds (pairs of unit equilateral triangles glued together along an edge). Diamonds come in three varieties, depending on orientation. Prove that precisely the same number of each variety must appear in the tiling.

Let $ABCD$ be a trapezium with $AB \parallel CD$ and diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersecting at $O$. The areas of the triangles $\triangle AOB$, $\triangle BOC$, $\triangle COD$, and $\triangle AOD$ are all non-integers.

It is known that the products of the areas of two pairs of these triangles are $576$ and $1296$, respectively.

- Determine the maximum possible area of the trapezium $ABCD$.
- Find $\dfrac{DC}{AB}$.


*Note:* $AD$ and $BC$ need not be equal, unlike what one might infer from the image.
